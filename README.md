# Sortings plays an important role in programming. It is used to organize the data in an ascending order or in descending oredr.

# Bubble_Sort
        In bubble sort we compare the neighbour elements. 
        If the condition like arr[j]>arr[j+1] is false then we swap them.
        In each pass the largest element placed at last

# Selection_Sort
        In selection sort we find the minimum element from the unsorted part.
        We then swap it with the first element of the unsorted part.
        In each pass, the smallest element is placed at its correct position.
# Insertion_Sort
In insertion sort, we assume the first element is sorted.
Then we pick the next element and insert it into its correct position in the sorted part.
It is efficient for small or nearly sorted arrays.
