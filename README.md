# Sortings plays an important role in programming. It is used to organize the data in an ascending order or in descending oredr.

# Bubble_Sort
        In bubble sort we compare the neighbour elements. 
        If the condition like arr[j]>arr[j+1] is false then we swap them.
        In each pass the largest element placed at last

# Selection_Sort
        In selection sort we find the minimum element from the unsorted part.
        We then swap it with the first element of the unsorted part.
        In each pass, the smallest element is placed at its correct position.
# Insertion_Sort
        In insertion sort, we assume the first element is sorted.
        Then we pick the next element and insert it into its correct position in the sorted part.
        It is efficient for small or nearly sorted arrays.
# Heap_Sort
        In heap sort we first build a max heap from the array.
        Then we swap the root (maximum) with the last element and reduce the heap size.
        We repeat heapifying and extracting until the array is sorted.
# Merge_Sort
        In merge sort we use the divide and conquer technique.
        We divide the array into two halves, sort them recursively, and merge them.
        It is stable and works well for large datasets.

 I update this repo regularly as I keep learning something new every day!
